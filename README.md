# MedSarthi: Your companion for reading and understanding prescriptions.

## Overview 

This repository contains the codebase and documentation for a Pharmacistâ€™s Assistant, leverages AI to automate the interpretation of handwritten prescriptions. By integrating a custom trained CNN + BiLSTM model with CTC loss, my solution converts prescription images into structured orders and flags potential dosage errors or conflicting medications. This not only streamlines pharmacy operations but also reduces manual errors, ultimately enhancing patient safety and operational efficiency.


## Solution Approach
The solution Approach can be summarized as follows:

1. Automates reading handwritten prescriptions: 
2. Converts prescriptions into structured orders: 
3. Alerts on dosage errors and conflicts:


## Results:
results of model after training

## Run application in local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install all necessary dependencies and libraries as specified in the repository.
3. Install requirements for streamlit app pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Set up the environment and configure the solution parameters according to your requirements.
